Modified E. coli CCM model: model and reference state (stationary fluxes and consistent metabolite concentrations)

* Generated by e_coli_ccm_SKM_make_model.m
* Fluxes are stationary (within the model)
* Concentrations are adjusted to be thermodynamically feasible

Matlab command for reading the model:

[network,c,v] = sbtab_network_state_load(FILENAME_ModelState.tsv);
