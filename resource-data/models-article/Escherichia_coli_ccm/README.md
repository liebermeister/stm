E. coli CCM model
==========================

Modified version of the original model from Noor et al. (2016), PLoS Comp. Biol.

In the model, exchange reactions were
  added to some of the biomass precursors and a stationary flux
  distribution was obtained from measured metabolic fluxes by
  projecting flux data onto the space of stationary fluxes while
  constraining the flux directions. Metabolite concentrations and
  thermodynamic forces for the reference state were determined by
  balancing \cite{lskl:10} of metabolite and reaction Gibbs free
  energy data. Data as in \cite{nfbd:16} were used in all cases.

Modifications:
* some kcat values were modified
* some metabolites were set internal (and draining reactions were added for these metabolites) to allow for a realistic steady-state flux within the model
