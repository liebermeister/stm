-----------------------------------------------------
Example models from the article "Structural thermokinetic modelling"
-----------------------------------------------------

All models were created in MATLAB using the Metabolic Network Toolbox
and the functions for Elasticity Sampling accompanying the article.

MATLAB functions can be freely downloaded from github:
https://github.com/liebermeister/stm

All models are provided in two formats, as SBML (.xml) and Matlab (.mat) files.
Files "..reference_state" contain the results of elasticity sampling.
