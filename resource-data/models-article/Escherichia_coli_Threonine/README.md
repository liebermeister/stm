Escherichia coli threonine pathway model
----------------------------------------

Model construction:
-------------------

1. The original threonine model from [1] in SBML format was obtained from Biomodels Database
   Biomodels Model ID: BIOMD0000000066

2. The following substances were set external: 'adp','atp','phos','nadp','nadph','asp','thr' 
   and a steady state was computed, starting from the original substance concentrations.

3. A new model was constructed, based on the original model's network structure and steady state, 
   by elasticity sampling (data in struct 'reference_state' in files .._reference_state).
