Metabolic fluxes in Escherichia coli (aerobic growth on glucose)
----------------------------------------------------------------


Model construction:
-------------------

1. The network structure of the genome-wide E. coli model iAF1260 was taken from [1].

2. A flux distribution for aerobic growth on glucose (with 593 active reactions) was taken from [2].

3. A kinetic model was constructed, based on network structure and flux distributions, 
   by elasticity sampling (data in struct 'reference_state' in files .._reference_state).
