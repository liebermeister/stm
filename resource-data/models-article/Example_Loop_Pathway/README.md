Linear pathway with loop: Test model for  
 synergies predicted from MCA, FBA, and MOMA
--------------------------------------------


Model construction:
-------------------

1. Based on the network structure, a model was created using the MNT toolbox.

2. Based on a stationary flux distribution, kinetic constants for the common 
   saturable modular rate law were determined by elasticity sampling
   (data in struct 'reference_state' in files .._reference_state). 


Model files:
------------

1. Escherichia_coli_Glycolysis.xml                   SBML file
2. Escherichia_coli_Glycolysis.mat                   MATLAB .mat file (for MNT toolbox)
3. Escherichia_coli_Glycolysis_reference_state.mat   MATLAB .mat file (for MNT toolbox)
