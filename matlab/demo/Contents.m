% Example matlab scripts for Structural Thermodynamic Modelling
% -------------------------------------------------------------
% 
% This directory contains three kinds of example m-files:
% 
% o The interactive demo script, "demo_stm_glycolysis.m", can be directly run 
%   in matlab and shows how STM with a simple model can be performed
%   by running a series of commands.
% 
% o The demo script "demo_stm_workflow" shows possible variations of this
%   workflow. It contains many possible alternatives that are currently commented out.
%   To apply STM to one of your models, you may start from this script
%   and modify it to adapt it to your needs.
% 
% o The directory 'article_figures' contains the matlab scripts that were use to generate
%   the figures in the STM article. 
% 
% All scripts use data from the 'resources' directory in the main directory.
% General numerical data are given in the subdirectory "data", 
% model-specific data are given in the subdirectories "models" and "models-article".
